This GINA package can display respawn times per zone. It can also display timers for each mob.

- Displays respawn times by zone: RespawnTimeDB.gtp
- Show mob timer: RespawnTimer.gtp

# How to use

## Download
To download the file, select `Download ZIP` from the green button labeled `Code` in the upper right corner of this page.
 
## Create RespawnTimer overlay

This is not required, but is recommended since this section can separate where the timer is displayed from the others.

- **Overlays tab:** Add Timer Overlays (watch icon) > change "Overlay#x" at center of window to "RespawnTimer" > Sort: Time Remaining > Save
- **Categories tab:** Add > Name: RespawnTimer > Timers Overlay: RespawnTimer

## Install gtp files
- **Sharing tab:** Import > From GINA Package File > `RespawnTimer.gtp` and `RespawnTimeDB.gtp`

## Config
Select the character in the pane on the left side of `GINA` and check the checkbox at the top of the `Respawn Time DB` tree. Leave the `Respawn Timer` unchecked for now.

## Start camp
When you zone or run the `/` or `/who` command, the respawn time for the zone you are in is displayed as a timer.
Find that time in the `Respawn Timer` tree and check it.

As you kill mobs, the respawn time for each mob will line up.

```
00:21:55  Garanel Rucksif
00:21:55  ^^^^^
```

When you kill a mob (and get xp) two timers appear. The timer with the mob name uses slain logs. slain logs are effective only for tanks and melee because the range of the slain logs is very small and you have to be close by. The second timer remedies that problem. xp log doesn't say what died, but this log reaches wide area. It would help the chain puller.

# Advance

## memo
For example, if you want to make a note of a nasty mob PH that has a slightly different respawn time.
```
/em ##freeti
```

## reset
If you want to erase all timers when moving to another camp.
```
/em ##reset
```

## add manually
For example, if you are med at a distance where slain cannot pick up and do not want to move.
```
/em ## %t
```
Note the space before the %. Without it, the % macro will not expand.

# Structure

Since I am not capable of manually inputting more than 150 triggers, this GINA package was generated by a python script.
If you want to modify the contents, make(1) will generate new gtp file.
```
csv --> RespawnTimer.py --> xml --> zip --> gtp --> GINA
```
